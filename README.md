For Testing the model, follow the instructions below

1) Download the file 'LoadModel.ipynb' from this repo.

2) Open the file in google colab ( https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index )

3) Downlaod the model files 'tf_model.h5' and 'tf_model.preproc' from the google link below.
Model folder link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rflKh7s9vz39MTFiyBU_D3wyfS_jVILq?usp=sharing

4) Create a new folder named 'model' inside your project and Upload the files 'tf_model.h5' and 'tf_model.preproc' to the new folder created 'model' in your project.

5) Make sure the upload is complete, it will appear before completeing in '/content/model/' path. (for loading we need to give the path of the folder and no just the .h5 file). After upload completion run the code.
